# liri-node-app

*About*
I have made a app using Liri. LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. This App was made to allow you the ability to utilize (Spotify, Bands in town, and OMDB), to look up songs, concerts, and movie information all in one place. To do this you will utilize the command line by entering simple commands. 


Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
The LIRI Bot was designed to produce search results based on the following commands:

node liri.js concert-this
node liri.js spotify-this-song
node liri.js movie-this
node liri.js do-what-it-says

Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
First you will need to clone this repository and use 'npm install' to gather the dependencies specified in the package.json file. You will also have to create a .env file containing the appropriate api keys, yours not mine.

Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
